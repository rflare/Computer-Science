# Welcome to Learn Computer Science!
Learn computer science is a site to help those who want to learn about computer science at an introductory level. I am a high school computer science teacher who wanted to make a course not only for my students, but anyone who wants to learn. Although this site follows the Ontario curriculum for computer studies in high school, anyone wanting to learn can follow along with no previous experience required.

## How to use this site
- View the course content in order or jump to any spot you want for [[Grade 11 Computer Science]]
